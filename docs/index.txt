Welcome to the KBus documentation
=================================

KBUS is a lightweight messaging system for Linux, particularly
aimed at embedded platforms. Message passing is managed by a kernel module, via
reading/writing ``/dev/kbus0`` style devices. Python bindings are provided, as
is a C library.
