Changes for the great reorganisation
====================================

In kbus_defns:

* Changed start_guard and end_guard - they now correspond to "Kbus" and
  "subK", instead of "kbus" and "subk". Which seems a reasonable change.

* New datastructure kbus_orig_from. This is the same shape as kbus_msg_id, but
  kept separate because it really *is* a new type of data.

* New fields in a message header, orig_from and extra (the latter is always
  zeroed by KBUS)

In kbus.c, always zero the "extras" field.

Propagate (but don't touch) the orig_from field. Print it out if necessary.

In Python ksock.py:

* Change KSock to Ksock throughout (better PEP 8, easier to type)

In Python messages.py:

* Changed START_GUARD and END_GUARD - they now correspond to "Kbus" and
  "subK", instead of "kbus" and "subk". Which matches the C.

* Add orig_from and extra to the message datastructure. Otherwise ignore
  extra.

* New class OrigFrom for orig_from

* The Message __repr__ now only shows arguments that are set, rather than
  producing a maximal argument list for the representation.

        NB: This means many of the doctests will need changing...





Don't forget to look at the C library as well...

(JavaScript and C++ bindings, elsewhere, will also need changing at some
point.)
