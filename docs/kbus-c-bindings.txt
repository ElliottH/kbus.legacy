KBUS C bindings
===============

*Proper documentation of the C bindings for KBUS (libkbus) will live here. For
the moment, here are some header files:*

* ``kbus/kbus_defns.h`` - the kernel header file, which defines the various
  datastructures, the IOCTLs, and some useful macros and functions. This
  header file is used by the kernel, and also by user space programs (although
  in this latter case normally by including the ``libkbus`` header file).

* ``libkbus/kbus.h`` - the main header file for ``libkbus``. This include the
  kernel header file for you.

* ``libkbux/limpet.h`` - the ``libkbus`` header file for Limpet code. Since
  Limpets are more normally used via the ``runlimpet`` application, this may
  or may not be of direct use.

kbus/kbus_defns.h
-----------------
*Please be aware that the comments in this file are currently inaccurate, and
scheduled to be rewritten. The datastructures are, of course, correct...*
